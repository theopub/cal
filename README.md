# Red Calendar

Red Calendar is an arts and action calendar that helps NYC gather without big tech middlemen. Managed by a team of editors, the Calendar also encourages cross-pollination among NYC’s leftist/arts/culture communities. Anyone can add events for free, pending editor approval!

Red Calendar is big-tech-free—no Meta, no AWS, no GCal. Each day's events reorder when you refresh. We are called Red Calendar because we wanted a color, and this was the shortest (and cheapest) url we could find that incorporated “calendar” and a color.
